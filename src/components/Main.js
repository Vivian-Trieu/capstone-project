                    <h1>Little Lemon</h1>
                    <h2>Chicago</h2>
                    <h6>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant,
                        focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration
                        from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally.
                        The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place
                        for a meal any time of the day.
                        <br />
                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States
                        to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family
                        recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant
                        and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines
                        from the Mediterranean region.
